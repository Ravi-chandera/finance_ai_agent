Select explanatory notes to the Statement of Audited Consolidated Interim Financial Results for the three months ended June 30,
2024
1. Audited Consolidated Interim Statement of Financial Results for the three months ended June 30, 2024 have been prepared in
accordance with the Indian Accounting Standard (referred to as "Ind AS") 34 - Interim Financial Reporting prescribed under
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to
time. Audited Consolidated Interim Statement of Financial Results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 have been
prepared on the basis of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 and the audited
condensed consolidated interim financial statements upto the end of the third quarter of the year ended March 31, 2024, which
are prepared in accordance with the Ind AS notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015. These
results have been reviewed by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on July 11, 2024.
The statutory auditors have expressed an unmodified audit opinion on these results.
2. The Board of Directors at its meeting held on July 11, 2024, has declared an interim dividend of ₹10.00 per equity share.
3. In April 2019, Computer Sciences Corporation (referred to as CSC) filed a legal claim against the Company in the Court of Northern
District of Texas and Dallas Division (trial court) alleging misappropriation of trade secrets and other CSC's confidential
information and sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, and unspecified monetary damages and disgorgement of
profits.
A trial before an advisory jury was held and on November 17, 2023, the jury returned an advisory verdict in favour of CSC, finding
that the Company misappropriated CSC's trade secrets and recommended compensation of US $70 million (equivalent to
₹584 crore) and a further punitive damage of US $140 million (equivalent to ₹1,168 crore) to be paid by the Company to
CSC. Subsequently, the parties filed their respective written submissions in the matter. On June 13, 2024, the trial court passed
a judgement as follows:
a) The Court ordered that the Company is liable to CSC for US $56 million (equivalent to ₹467 crore) in compensatory damages
and US $112 million (equivalent to ₹935 crore) in exemplary damages.
b) The Court also assessed that the Company is liable for US $25 million (equivalent to ₹209 crore) in prejudgment interest
through June 13, 2024.
c) The Court also passed certain injunction and other reliefs against the Company.

The Company, based on external opinion and legal assessment, believes that it has a strong case and would defend its position
vigorously and pursue legal remedies to overturn the adverse judgement of the trial court.
4. The results for three months ended June 30, 2024, are available on the BSE Limited website

July 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST
our outlook for the future or which could be construed as a forward-looking
statement must be reviewed in conjunction with the risks that the company
faces. We have outlined these risks in second slide of the quarterly fact sheet
available on our website and e-mail out to those who have subscribed on our
mailing list.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Krithi.
K Krithivasan: Thank you, Nehal. Good day, everyone. I'm very pleased to report a good start
to the new fiscal year. Our Q1 FY '25 revenue grew at 5.4% in rupee terms,
4.4% in constant currency terms and 3.9% in dollar terms. All our markets have
returned to growth on a sequential basis, similarly almost all our verticals also
saw positive sequential growth, except for CMI.
Our ability to deliver on large-scale complex engagements, projects of national
importance and mission critical services for the world's leading companies
have helped us in winning market share. Our operating margin for the quarter
came in at 24.7% and net margin at 19.2%.
I'll now invite Samir and Milind to go over different aspects of our performance
during the quarter. I'll step in later to provide more color on the demand trends
we are seeing in our business. Over to you Samir.
Samir Seksaria: Thank you, Krithi. Good day, everyone. In the first quarter of FY '25, our
revenue was ₹62,613 crores which is a year-over-year growth of 5.4%. In
dollar terms, the revenue was $7,505 million and that's a Y-o-Y growth of 3.9%
and in constant currency, our revenues grew 4.4%. Our Q1 operating margin
was at 24.7% in spite of a 170 basis point headwind from annual wage hikes.
In addition, third-party expenses also increased. These were offset by
operating efficiency, including better productivity, improved utilization and
reduction in subcontractor expenses.
Net income margin in Q1 was 19.2% and our EPS grew 10% year-over-year.
Our accounts receivable DSO was at 70 days in dollar terms and up 5 days
year-over-year.
Net cash from operations was $1.34 billion, which is 92.8% of net income.
Free cash flows were $1.23 billion and invested funds at the end of the period
stood at $5.59 billion. The Board has recommended an interim dividend of
₹10 per share.

requirements, and these are moving more and more real time in
nature. This is another driver for the transformation of core

The addition during the quarter was 5,452. We will continue to recalibrate our
hiring for the year based on the demand outlook.
We are focused on re-skilling and organically developing the required
competencies amongst our talent base. Employees logged 11 million learning
hours during this quarter and acquired 1.2 million competencies. We have one
of the most comprehensive talent development programs in the world, helping
us stay ahead of the curve and continue to innovate and adapt to keep pace
with the evolving business needs.
| 4Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call
July 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST
This program has earned us the respect and admiration of our customers and
employees alike. Our workforce continues to be very diverse with 151
nationalities and with women making up 35.5% of our base. Towards driving a
more performance-focused work culture, we rolled out double-digit wage hikes
for high performers and an average 4.5% to 7% wage hike for the rest of the
employees, with effect from 1st of April.
All our efforts in rewarding the best talent in the industry are reflected in our
retention rates, which are one of the best amongst industry peers. Our LTM
retention in IT services was at 12.1% at the end of Q1, down 40 basis points
sequentially and in our comfort range of 11% to 13%.
I will now request Krithi to speak on the various demand drivers seen this
quarter.
K Krithivasan: Thank you, Milind.
I am pleased to report a strong start to the new fiscal year with all-round growth
across industries and markets, led by cost optimization and business
transformation. Cost optimization remains the top customer priority, including
vendor consolidation and operating model transformation.
Enterprises are increasingly relying on technology to help improve their
competitive advantage, transforming the way they operate. Client spending
under the business transformation initiatives included supply chain
modernization, sustainability, enhanced customer and employee experience,
technology modernization, cloud, data and analytics and AI/GenAI initiatives.
We are investing in our workforce at scale, deepening our ecosystem
partnerships and strengthening our IT teams. TCS, with its full services
capability and industry-specific contextual knowledge, has always remained
relevant to clients. Our strategy has resonated with clients continuing to entrust
us with large and strategic deals.
TCV in Q1 was at $8.3 billion. The BFSI TCV was at $2.7 billion, while the
TCV for our Consumer Business Group was at $1.1 billion. The TCV of deals
signed in North America stood at $4.6 billion.
Having said that, during Q1, we continued to see the dichotomy that we have
witnessed over the past six quarters.
| 5Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call
July 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST
While larger and strategic transformation programs with enterprise-wide scope
or benefits, example, cloud or data foundation, are continuing apace, some of
the smaller programs with narrower scope benefits are coming under more
stringent scrutiny, tending to get deprioritized. At the same time, we are seeing
clients spend on initiatives oriented towards cost optimization, giving them
immediate ROI.
Let me now walk you through our segmental performance. As a reminder, all
growth numbers are in the year-on-year constant currency terms, unless
otherwise mentioned.
• BFSI, our biggest vertical, returned to growth sequentially. On a Y-o-Y basis,
it declined 0.9%.
o For the BFSI industry, the wave of the net interest income that was
strong in 2023 has been waning down in 2024. Clients are now balancing
their transformation priorities to ensure business resilience and
innovation to improve cost to income ratio. In the near term, we will see
tech spend on enabling new partnership and ecosystem models, stronger
security practices to tackle cybercrime, data governance and
democratization to address risks and regulatory scrutiny, and fully
integrated digital operating models.
o Longer term, BFSI clients are expected to increase their spending
towards developing integrated models using Cloud and AI, mitigating risk
of legacy systems and those aimed at boosting customer experience.
o ING Belgium partnered with TCS to modernize its legacy applications for
business lending, bonus and warrants management application and
branch banking operations. With our contextual knowledge of the bank’s
IT ecosystem, we collaborated in their simplification journey, providing
ING with modernized microservices-based, cloud-hosted applications.
The modernization initiative will provide simplified operations, seamless
customer experience, optimized and modern front end, simplified
technology landscape, higher productivity, and lower cost of operations
for ING. This success story is a good example of the end-to-end large-
scale IT modernization work we are doing for our clients.
• Consumer Business Group saw sequential growth for the second quarter, led
by demand for cost optimization, improving end-customer experiences and
Enterprise Applications Modernizations and Transformations. On a Y-o-Y
basis, it declined 0.3%.
| 6Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call
July 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST
o Optimizing IT costs and realizing efficiencies is a big priority for
Consumer Businesses. To that end, we see good demand for Operating
Model Transformation and Vendor Consolidation as key themes.
o AO World, the UK's most trusted electricals retailer engaged TCS to
transform the systems that underpin its Finance and Operations functions
to respond to constantly changing business dynamics and customer
expectation and maintain the competitive advantage in the industry. TCS
led this transformation through the design, solution blueprinting and
implementation of the cloud-based platform. Through this initiative, the
customer could streamline its business processes, automate numerous
workflows and approval processes, create robust and resilient integrated
systems, and bring transparency in financial reconciliation.
o bpost, also known as the Belgian Post Group, a leading European
postal services company, partnered with TCS to digitally transform the
retail front-office. TCS developed a modern, scalable, and portable POS
solution using open-source technologies and cloud-native architecture,
reimagining both the customer journey and employee experience, and
redefining the front-office environment. The new solution has improved
customer and employee experience by reducing wait-times and enabling
many self-service options for customers.
• Manufacturing continued with its positive streak and grew 9.4%, led by broad-
based growth in all sub-sectors. Specific areas like Smart Manufacturing,
Renewable energy, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), Grid
modernization with Digital solutions, supply chain transformation and vendor
consolidation are showing a positive trend.
o Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), UK’s largest luxury automotive manufacturer
has partnered with TCS to implement SAP Service Parts Management.
This streamlined JLR’s aftermarket parts supply chain, unifying multiple
legacy systems across their two iconic brands into a single system. JLR
benefited from optimized inventory worldwide, improved stock turnover,
enhanced supply chain visibility, and improved collaboration and
communication with suppliers. This also established common processes
to support standardized operations across both brands—Jaguar and
Land Rover.
o This success story showcases how the client embarked on its supply
chain transformation wherein their key objective of ‘Global Inventory
Optimization and Systems Consolidation’ was achieved, and how TCS
| 7Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call
July 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST
with its large project expertise and contextual knowledge was able to
deliver substantial savings to the client.
• Life Sciences and Healthcare continued to do well and grew 4.0%.
o The pharmaceutical companies continue to invest heavily in R&D, supply
chain transformation, smart manufacturing, clinical unified platform,
cognitive-based case intake automation, and customer experience
transformation for patients, health care personnel, and others as part of
business transformation.
o In the healthcare customers, we see vertical integration, significant
increase in home care and virtual care, and adoption of value-based care
at scale.
o All these initiatives are leading to increased IT services spend for us.
• Energy Resources and Utilities also grew 5.7%.
o ERU companies are investing in transforming business and asset
portfolios towards a more sustainable future, including renewables
generation capacity, transmission and distribution to bring the energy to
where it’s needed, energy storage, and new ways of running the grid like
Distributed Energy Resource Management and Virtual Power Plants.
TCS is engaged in pioneering work in such initiatives for its clients.
• CMI continued to face business challenges and declined 7.4%.
o Given the uncertain macroeconomic outlook, clients are focused on
realizing the benefits from the investments in 5G made during the
pandemic period before investing in any large-scale programs.
As these challenges abate, we expect spending on tech stack
modernization to grow as telcos leverage automation, network
intelligence, and virtualization to align with shifting industry trends.
Investments will be oriented towards enhancing business and operational
performance by leveraging real-time intelligence, scalable and modular
networks, and partner ecosystems.
Current spend in this sector is led by initiatives in cost optimization,
vendor consolidation, and integrated operations.
• Technology and Services returned to sequential growth after 5 quarters. On a
Y-o-Y basis, it declined 3.9%. Customers in this vertical remain cautious
about new spending until business growth momentum picks up. However, we
| 8Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call
July 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST
are very excited about a marquee deal we secured with a leading tech
company, where we will showcase the depth and breadth of all our service
offerings.
o We expanded our two- decade long partnership with Xerox to develop a
new agile, cloud-first operating model in an end-to-end transformation
program designed to fast track the evolution of the company into a
simplified, services-led, software-enabled organization. We will consolidate
Xerox’s technology services to improve business outcomes, migrate
complex legacy data centers to a public cloud, deploy a cloud-based Digital
ERP platform to transform business processes and incorporate GenAI into
operations to help drive sustainable growth. We will be leveraging the deep
capabilities of our service practices such as AI.Cloud, Enterprise Solutions
(including CrystallusTM) and Cognitive Business Operations (including
CognixTM). We will also build an AI-first enterprise platform for Xerox.
Coming to our Service Practices, AI. Cloud, Cyber-Security and Enterprise
Solutions led the growth this quarter. We launched new labs, Centers of
Excellence and Delivery Centers focused on AI, IoT (Internet of Things) and
Digital Engineering. We have also further expanded our partnership and
alliances ecosystem by onboarding new partners in the areas of ER&D
(utilities, Process industry and Consumer Products industry segments),
Cyber Security (cloud workload and endpoint security, threat intelligence, and
cyberattack response services), Gen AI, e-commerce platforms, business
consulting for Public Sector and Enterprise Integration Services. We continue
to see global recognition across our service offerings.
• AI.Cloud: Organizations are seeing Cloud, Data and GenAI adoption as
essential for delivering superior customer experience, remaining cost
competitive as well as be able to roll out differentiated products and services
rapidly. There is a renewed focus on data strategy, data governance and use
of analytics driven by the desire to leverage AI and GenAI.
Gen AI continues to hold major mindshare, and this is increasing by the day
with newer models and techniques coming to the market almost on a daily /
weekly basis. Customers are looking at scaling out the POCs and pilots by
implementing necessary guardrails. Mature customers with a solid cloud and
data foundation that were able to experiment with multiple GenAI use cases
are now looking to reimagine parts of their value chain to make them AI-
native. This AI first business strategy is increasingly seen as the eventual
long-term aspirational goal. While the interest is strong, organizations are
| 9Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call
July 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST
taking a calibrated approach to measure the risk potential and organizational
impact while chalking out their roadmap for GenAI adoption. TCS has been
batting on the front foot with all the required investments made to participate
in this space and opportunity.
In this quarter, over 270 AI/GenAI engagements have been deployed or are
in various stages of progress. Engagements that have successfully gone live
include those enabling dynamic pricing strategies, improved product quality,
transformed customer experience and significant productivity uplift in
business operations, software development & IT Operations. Our AI and Gen
AI pipeline has also doubled in the quarter to US$1.5 billion.
During the quarter, we launched TCS AI WisdomNextᵀᴹ, a platform that
aggregates multiple GenAI services into a single interface and enables
organizations to rapidly adopt next-gen technologies at scale, efficiently and
within regulatory frameworks.
The platform offers a comprehensive suite of modular, reusable components
and industry-specific, prefabricated solution blueprints that are easy to use
and enable faster business value realization. It can evaluate the accuracy of
the AI model used and offers fine-tuning as a service.
• IoT and DE: We continue to see demand for IoT Platforms and Digital
Engineering capabilities across different application areas. Few examples
include: (1) Life Science and healthcare customers continue to invest in
remote patient monitoring, diagnosis through connected devices leading to
more software platform solutions and services. (2) Hi-Tech/ TSS customers
are looking at new age skillsets which include chip design and optimization of
manufacturing operations through automation (3) In the manufacturing space,
key areas are - Factory transformation (smart manufacturing / factory of
future), PLM services and smart product engineering. (4) Energy
management solutions like TCS Clever EnergyTM are seeing good demand
from customers across retail and manufacturing.
• Cyber Security services continued to grow this quarter. The focus areas of
our customers have been Network security, Identity and Access Management
modernization, Risk & Compliance and Cloud Security.
• Our Interactive services saw good growth this quarter across multiple
offerings. The effective integration of technology and creativity is a key theme
| 10Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call
July 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST
for all marketers. Our narrative around the need to improve CMO-CIO
collaboration is being received well. CMOs understand that it is of paramount
importance to connect the dots of complex technology systems, AI and data
– and that this connecting of the dots, along with creativity as the multiplier is
key to help brands in their responsible growth journey.
• Our Cognitive Business Operations services also saw good bookings and
revenue growth in both IT IS and BPS. As businesses are looking to get a
heads-up on the long-term view, investments are made in current operations
to make it leaner and more efficient. Our approach led by modern tech-led
transformation & assets such as ignio™, Cognix™ & MFDM™ is gaining
good traction.
• Lastly, in the Enterprise Solutions Unit (ESU), clients continue to invest in
clean and sustainable digital core by modernizing their ERP. We will continue
to invest and strengthen our joint go-to-market approach with our partners.
Moving on to geographies, Emerging markets continued showing superior
and diversified growth. India led with +61.8% growth, Middle East & Africa
grew +8.5%, Asia Pacific grew 7.6% while Latin America grew +6.3%.
• Among major markets, the United Kingdom led with +6.0% growth. IT
services spend continues to be more resilient in the UK, and is expected to
remain on the growth path.
• Europe grew 0.9%. IT services spend remained flat. In addition to other
growth areas, sustainability initiatives and compliance of regulatory
requirements is a key focus area amongst European clients.
• The biggest positive was North America returning to sequential growth
after 5 quarters. On a Y-o-Y basis, it declined 1.1%. Overall IT services
spending is stable in the geo; however, clients are neither going for large
scale capex initiatives nor ramping down with deep spending cuts. There are
tailwinds in the form of consumer demand, employment rates and technology
innovation and headwinds coming from rising government and consumer
debt, inflation and interest rates.
We remain focused on delivering to the best of our capabilities and improve
market share across industries, services and geographies.
We can now open the line for questions.

Ankur Rudra: We've seen an element of pickup in overall growth momentum this quarter.
However, if I peel out the growth from India, the growth in the international
business is about 1.5% both sequentially and year-over-year on constant
currency terms. So, in this context and the fact that deal wins are sort of weaker
than the last four quarter average, the question is, what gives you the
confidence that fiscal '25 will truly be better than fiscal '24?
K Krithivasan: Thanks, Ankur. We have said that FY'25 will be better than FY'24 overall. If
you compare current quarter’s performance with Q4 (last quarter), we see
sequential growth. Even leaving India out, almost all our verticals and all our
geographies have grown. So, while India growth has been substantial,
compared to previous quarter, the other sectors have also really done well.
Going by the fact that growth has been broad-based, is what is giving us the
confidence that this year will be better than last year. As we explained before,
on the TCV side, we find it's more a timing issue because the pipeline is quite
strong. We are not too worried about the TCV being lower than last quarter.
Ankur Rudra: Okay. Appreciate it. The following question for me would be on Generative AI.
You did highlight that your overall AI pipeline has strengthened. But if you just
stay with Generative AI, how's that impacting your business? If you can give
us some color in terms of how it's impacting specific projects and customer
perception. A related question is, do you feel that Generative AI in client
conversations and client thinking is potentially creating a headwind for
spending on IT services?
K Krithivasan: There is always a discussion in almost any new program we do, even if it's an
AMS (Application Management Services) program or AD (Application
Development) program we do. There is a discussion on can we leverage
Generative AI, can we bring in more productivity that discussion always
happens.
We also look for opportunities to bring in productivity or other value efficiencies
through Generative AI. Clients do want us to look at Generative AI as one of
the levers to better deliver in terms of cycle time or in terms of cost or quality.
That discussion always happens, but we have not seen Gen AI as a headwind
so far.

Ankur Rudra: Any comments on pricing given the nature of the business. Thank you.
Samir Seksaria: Pricing overall has remained stable. While there could be aberrations at an
individual customer level or the phase in which deals which we are facing, but
at a portfolio level there is nothing material to call out. As you would have seen
realizations also have been improving sequentially.
Ankur Rudra: Appreciate it. Thank you and best of luck.
Moderator: Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Sudheer Guntupalli from
Kotak Mahindra AMC. Please go ahead.
Sudheer Guntupalli: Hi, Kriti. Congrats on a good set of numbers. In March, you indicated that the
demand visibility has certainly improved over December quarter. Now you
delivered growth better than expectations. In that backdrop, just trying to get a
context of your comments in the press that you don’t want to yet call out the
sustainability of current growth number given the volatile environment.
Is it just a philosophical stance you are taking not to indulge in near-term
guesswork or quarterly guidance given the uncertainty or is this by any chance
led by a relative weakening of demand visibility versus March quarter for
whatsoever reasons?
What I am trying to understand is that directionally are we seeing a steady
improvement or stability in demand over time or is demand moving more like a
sinusoidal curve over quarters?
K Krithivasan: Sudheer when we announced last quarter, I do know that we said that there is
an improving demand environment. What we said is we believe we are
confident that FY25 will be better than FY24. And that is based on how FY24
panned out and how we started seeing the early quarter of FY25.
But it does not mean that the uncertainty has gone away. We still see situations
where clients are ramping down programs or re-evaluating programs at very
short notice. And that is the reason we believe that it is too early to call a
sustained growth momentum or a demand stability.
It depends a lot on the economic outlook of our customers. It is certainly not
philosophical, but it is quite practical Sudheer.
Sudheer Guntupalli: And the second question is on your other statement that clients are neither
going for large-scale technology initiatives nor going for deep spending cuts.
| 13Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call
July 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST
So if we were to quantify this qualitative statement, is it fair to say that since
the deep spend cuts are already in the denominator, incrementally not having
them should still be a mathematical tailwind for us in terms of growth?
K Krithivasan: See the way I would characterize this there are long-standing programs. As
long as they are delivering incremental value to our customers, they are
continuing. And if there is a limited budget available our customers are re-
evaluating. Should they be starting a new program which gives a better ROI?
It could be discretionary program or it could also be a cost optimization
program as against the next phase of a long-standing program. So whichever
is giving them a better ROI is being adopted and lesser ROI programs are
passed. So that is the way I characterize it. And it was a situation last quarter
also and there has not been a material change in that situation.
Sudheer Guntupalli: Okay, sir. Thank you so much and all the best.
Moderator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Kumar Rakesh from BNP Paribas.
Please go ahead.
Kumar Rakesh: Hi, good evening. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is more
of a request, Krithi. If you could consider starting to give guidance on a full year
basis that would be helpful because I really don’t understand why a large
company and successful one like TCS should not have a guidance when
almost every other peer of yours have.
And the challenge which at least I face is the operating metrics which you share
are not enough to give us a full picture of how the trends are panning out. The
deal TCV has a very poor correlation with the revenue trend and the other
operating matrices also are relatively lesser than what the peers have been
giving.
Now demand appears to have started stabilizing. You have settled in your
office for a few quarters now. So now may be a good time to relook at this
strategy whether you want to start giving a guidance. I understand TCS has
not in the past, but may be a good start to give and if you take a feedback and
if you still conclude that you should not give a guidance then at least maybe
start giving some more operating metrics such as order backlog or ACV
numbers, which can help us in modelling and come to a sense that what
direction the growth potentially could be?
| 14Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call
July 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST
K Krithivasan: Sure, Kumar. We will definitely consider that. You see, it's been a considered
stand for a long time because we believe that there is a certain amount of
prudence in not giving guidance because it helps us in driving growth and
maximizing growth based on what we see in the market space. But we will
consider your request and we'll have an internal discussion and come back to
you.
Kumar Rakesh: That would be great. Thanks. My second question specifically was on the
GenAI side. So, you did talk about $1.5 billion of deal pipeline on AI and GenAI
side. Can you give some sense how the booking and revenue conversion could
possibly be? You have spoken about 270 projects you are working on. So, is
it fair to expect that about triple digit million dollars of total revenue TCV you
may have been working on the GenAI side?
K Krithivasan: At this time, we don't want to give that number, because these projects also
tend to be not very large. In the past also, you mentioned many of them tend
to be smaller projects, small duration projects. But this quarter, we did win a
large project as well, where we are establishing an AI office for one of our
customers, which is fairly large.
But otherwise, these projects tend to be small. When we are relooking, maybe
we will consider this request as well, when we are ready to provide a number
in terms of the revenue or order book in AI, we'll do it.
Kumar Rakesh: Great.
K Krithivasan: Therefore, we have to stabilize and scale in the service, before we are able to
give some metrics.
Kumar Rakesh: Sure. Makes sense. Thanks. One question on the BFSI side. So, it was
encouraging to see that BFSI has now returned to growth. So, is that a
reflection of absence of last two quarters of furlough? Or you are seeing some
recovery on the ground in terms of client engagement as well?
K Krithivasan: I would say there is some positive movement because as I was telling
somebody else, our BFSI North America has done relatively well, which is not
really impacted by furlough. So, this is BFSI performance to a great extent is,
I would say, North America performance as well.
Kumar Rakesh: Got it. Thanks a lot.

July 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST
Moderator: Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Abhishek Pathak from
Motilal Oswal. Please go ahead.
Abhishek Pathak: Hi. Thank you for the opportunity. My first question was on the communications
vertical. Sir, what near-term catalysts do you see in this vertical which could
meaningfully alter client behavior and what could bring it back to growth?
We've seen almost five quarters of a decline now. So, when do you expect the
historic capex that the operators have done to trickle down to services?
That's one. And secondly, on the FY '24, another strong quarter. So, do you
think client behavior here is any different to, let's say, BFSI where cost takeout
is the main theme? Do you see more adventurous projects here or is the theme
pretty much similar? Thank you.
K Krithivasan: Abhishek, first on CMI, there are a couple of factors playing out here. Many of
the telcos invested heavily for 5G rollout and they have not seen the expected
return so far. For them to invest more, we believe, they're looking for a lower
interest rate environment before they can embark on new transformative
programs.
From that perspective, lowering interest rate would be a good trigger for us to
see. It is our expectation for us to see project of more investment and hence
more IT projects to be kicked off. Life Sciences like you said, has been bucking
the trend.
That is also more to do with the non-cyclical nature of the industry. People tend
to consume more of those services in good times and bad times. And which
also because of that, creates more opportunity for drug discovery, research.
To that extent, it's behaving in a very secular way.
Abhishek Pathak: Got it. Thanks.
Moderator: Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Ravi Menon from
Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Ravi Menon: Hi, thank you. You spoke about how we've finally seen America and North
America come back to sequential growth. I don't think even during the financial
crisis we've had a situation where we have five quarters of sequential decline.
So this was an unusual time, but do you think that we finally bottomed out here
and should we see sequential growth from here in North America?
| 16Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call
July 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST
K Krithivasan: Ravi, I don't want to say this now because it's the first quarter of broad-based
growth we have seen after few quarters. And see while in 2008, what also
happened, as soon as the crisis hit, we also got multiple M&A opportunities, so
which actually increased our growth because some of the clients started
investing towards consolidation of the systems.
Today we don't have that scenario. It is a scenario of more wait and watch,
because of which we don't find new investments either towards cost
optimization or particularly discretionary spend not happening. So that's the
reason we are hesitant to say we have bottomed out. We are watching this
space and working closely with our customers to maximize the opportunities in
front of us.
Ravi Menon: Thank you, Krithi. And if you look at the trailing 12 months book to bill as well,
when we started seeing that drop, that's when I think is a very new start. Should
we think about that as a lead indicator? And now we've seen that trend up.
Last quarter of course, you had a really extraordinarily good looking quarter.
So, that moved that up as well.
But we are trending above 1.35, 1.37 for three quarters. So should we think
about that as a good leading indicator, if not for a quarterly indicator, but at
least for the full year?
K Krithivasan: Ravi, I did not get the question fully, but from a book to bill perspective, last
quarter was very good. This quarter we had a lower TCV. As we are explaining,
our overall pipeline has remained strong, both qualified pipeline and total
pipelines remain strong.
The TCV has been lower this quarter it's more of a timing issue. Some of the
large programs that we thought that we would close were pushed back by a
few weeks or maybe a month or so. But we're confident those orders will be
booked in Q2.
You can never read too much into a TCV on a single quarter, you have to read
it on a longer period of time. And it remains within our stated goal of $7 billion
to $9 billion per quarter is the comfort zone we have set for our order booking.
We are currently well within that range.
Ravi Menon: Thanks. And one last question if I may you were, I think moving to a pattern of
on boarding all the fresh graduates you make offers to in the first half of the
| 17Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call
July 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST
year, right? This year, are you planning to continue that or should we see this
more spread out over the quarters?
Milind Lakkad: We have on boarded 11,000 trainees in this quarter and we also have
concluded the National Qualifier Test and this will further add to that number.
Obviously, some of the freshers’ induction will continue during the quarters. To
what volume, that is something which will be recalibrated over the next few
quarters.
Ravi Menon: Thank you and best of luck.
Moderator: Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan
from Investec. Please go ahead.
Nitin Padmanabhan: Hi. Good evening. I had three questions. The first one is on the press
conference you had mentioned that you look at three indicators broadly when
you look to assess the recovery. So I think it was the evaluation of ongoing
projects, how much people want to spend on cost optimization and how much
people want to invest. Could you please expand on that, at least from a BFSI
and retail CPG perspective? So that's the first one on how you're seeing trends
across those three buckets.
The second is on margin levers. I think last year, after the first quarter, we saw
almost 100 basis points margin expansion each quarter. But since then, I think
we have sort of brought down subcontracting fairly well. We have also
improved utilization fairly. So just wanted your thoughts on the puts and takes
on margins, on how we should think about it on a going-forward basis? And
lastly, ISG basically spoke about some 30% cost savings in ADM and infra due
to GenAI. I just wanted to understand your experience on that and how you're
seeing that pan out. Thank you.
K Krithivasan: Nitin, while I did talk about re-evaluation of projects and then also focus on cost
optimization and discretionary, the point I also keep mentioning is we don't see
a material change between the customer sentiment between last quarter and
this quarter. They continue to validate projects and cost optimization projects
get a priority over new discretionary project if they are not able to see a short-
term ROI.
And this will change only when there is a long-term certainty on the economic
outlook. Till that happens, the pattern of whatever is happening, whatever
happened in the previous quarters will continue. That's the reason also why we
| 18Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call
July 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST
are not calling out that growth is back or this momentum will be sustained,
because customers do take decisions at a very short notice.
Regarding your comment on cost saving of 30% on GenAI, this is depending
on the type of engagement, type of project. We have done POC’s also, close
to more than 100, 150 projects where we have tested this out on terms of
software productivity. It varies anywhere between 5% to 25%. And it also
depends on which phase of the project that you are working on.
If you are talking only about a testing project, that could probably yield a better
productivity gain. We have seen software engineering projects that give
productivity anywhere, as I said, between 5% to 20%. And it also depends on
the type of technology employed. But we do see about 5% to 20% depending
on the type of project is thumb rule that's quite possible.
Samir Seksaria: Regarding the margins, the good thing for us is the biggest headwind which
we have in terms of wage inflation is taken upfront. And as you rightly called
out, we typically inch up from that in the following quarters. Last year, our
execution rigor ensured a good trajectory sequentially each quarter.
Subcontractor cost was one of the critical levers in that improvisation.
This year, we believe subcontractor cost has bottomed out or will remain stable
around this level, need not be an incremental lever. In the short term, pyramid,
productivity and utilization still would be the lever and utilization, though we
have harped upon it considerably last year, still provides some opportunity.
Nitin Padmanabhan: Sure. So Krithi, just had a follow-up. So, the revaluation of ongoing projects, I
think last quarter was pretty bad (4QFY24), not only for you, but for everybody.
There was a lot of reprioritization of projects. From a trend perspective, are you
seeing that come off or it is still extremely uncertain? Well, it may not have
been better this quarter, you see that it is still very uncertain on the
reprioritization.
K Krithivasan: This quarter, that is Q1, has been relatively better for us. But we don't know,
overall situation remains volatile. So, that is the reason we are continuing to
stay cautious on our outlook for the next few quarters.
Nitin Padmanabhan: Sure, that is very helpful. Thank you so much and all the very best.
Moderator: Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Sandeep Shah from
Equirus Securities. Please go ahead.
| 19Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call
July 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST
Sandeep Shah: Yes. Thanks for the opportunity. Krithi, just wanted to understand, is it fair to
believe that the first quarter performance has been higher than the
management expectation and what has led to this? Is it largely better than
expected discretionary spend revival or better than expected ramp-up in the
cost take-out deals?
K Krithivasan: Sandeep, probably we knew the beginning of the quarter, this is where we were
heading towards is what I would say. So to that extent, I wouldn't call it better
than expected.
Sandeep Shah: And second, in terms of ramp-down pace in the discretionary project, are you
witnessing any kind of declining pace in the ramp-down of discretionary project
on a Q-on-Q or a Y-o-Y basis? Or do you believe the pace of ramp-down
continues to remain at the same elevated level and there is no change in the
pace?
K Krithivasan: See, as I mentioned before, Q1 was slightly better, but we think it is too early
to call that the trend has set in already, like we have to be watchful because
the overall sentiment has not changed.
Sandeep Shah: And Krithi, last question in terms of Annuity projects, which are larger projects
coming for renewal, what is your experience in terms of clients negotiating for
a productivity gain because of GenAI? Is it the earlier response also been true
for such kind of an experience on a large renewal where you expect 5% to 20%
reduction in those renewals?
K Krithivasan: No. See, Sandeep, just to make it clear, I said the 5% to 20% productivity on
certain phases of the programs are possible. I didn't say the entire project end-
to-end life cycle, we can get 5% to 20%. It depends on the individual project
and also on the technology, architecture, everything they use.
Coming back to renewal, it's a common experience that the customers do
experience a productivity improvement but what they also do at that time is
usually they add more scope at the time of renewal so that it is to a great extent
top line neutral for us and we also bring productivity. So, those discussions
continue.
Sometimes we see opportunities for using GenAI and wherever you are able
to use GenAI and then offer some productivity, we offer those productivity to
customers. But if you ask me that is it widespread, I won't say it's very
widespread at this time. Like customers do expect productivity but asking for
| 20Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call
July 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST
extreme or a high level of productivity gain through GenAI is not a very common
place.
Like the discussions happen, we do offer to a customer to explore GenAI for
software engineering and building productivity, but it is not becoming a huge
demand yet.
Sandeep Shah: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you and all the best.
Moderator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Vibhor Singhal from Nuvama
Equities. Please go ahead.
Vibhor Singhal: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, two questions from my side. One,
Krithi, just wanted to understand on the retail segment. I mean, this is a quarter
in which we kind of believe we've turned the corner.
But for us to be able to report growth on a sustainable basis in this, what exactly
are the clients' worries in the sector at this point of time? So, like in BFSI, we
know that I think the US macro improves. I think that should lead to some, let's
say, incremental spending or a revival of tech spending that they have put on
hold.
Interest rate cuts could be possible, triggers and all. But what is that is keeping
these retail clients their spend on hold? And what could possibly change in the
coming quarters for us to start reporting growth in this segment on a
sustainable basis?
K Krithivasan: Vibhor, like there could be a couple of points. One is the overall consumer
confidence. The second is also inflation. Because what we see is a varying
trend like even in the last few quarters. We have seen some quarters where
the essential segment does well, some quarters the essential doesn't do well,
speciality does well. So it's a fairly complex situation on which segment does
well.
But I would say broadly, it should depend on the interest rates and the
consumer confidence in the market. We have seen growth in the last two
quarters. But we need, as I said if the confidence on consumer confidence or
outlook is poor in the coming quarters it may take a hit again.
Vibhor Singhal: Got it. But then improving macro situation in which maybe inflation is coming
down with the CPI data today or let's say there's some possibility of let's say,
| 21Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call
July 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST
interest rate cuts you expect this segment those should act as tailwinds for the
sector.
K Krithivasan: Yes, like if overall confidence goes up and the inflation comes under control,
we should expect a pickup in the medium term in this segment.
Vibhor Singhal: Got it. That's really helpful. Just my last question on the manufacturing and
healthcare verticals. Now, these two verticals have done really well for us
especially over the past three quarters. They've been doing well for almost the
entire industry with the kind of spends in that. Any possible headwinds that you
are seeing in this segment or at least at this point of time the growth momentum
should continue?
K Krithivasan: By and large, we are fine. But that could be in terms of like if you take
automotive industry with the advent of EVs coming in, the whole industry is
getting reshaped. So there would be some changes in the spending priority or
investment priority in this industry. So that would be something to watch out for
like adoption of EVs and how the OEMs themselves are going towards vertical
integration. How much they do that vertical integration, how much they impact
the tier 1s. Those are the areas that we have to watch out for.
Vibhor Singhal: Got it. Sure. Thank you so much for taking my questions and I wish you all the
best.
Moderator: Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Gaurav Rateria from
Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Gaurav Rateria: Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first question is around the nature of
deal pipeline. If you could just a little bit elaborate more on what kind of deals
you're seeing in the pipeline and has there been any shift in the mix of the
deals towards more smaller deals that get consumed into revenue faster or it
continues to remain the way it was in the last few quarters?
K Krithivasan: Yes. Gaurav, the type of work the deals, are led by cost optimization and
discretionary spending. Within that you can have programs like vendor
consolidation, operating model transformation, application modernization.
I would say there is not a major shift, okay, but we do hear more about
application modernization compared to the past. And on the discretionary
spend side, you also look at a supply chain modernization, customer
experience transformation, those kinds of programs we keep seeing.
| 22Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call
July 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST
From the nature of the opportunity, typically the cost optimization programs
tend to be more tenured because customers give us a large chunk of their AMS
for a longer tenure, but whereas the discretionary programs tend to be more
short tenure.
But overall, if you look at that average tenure, I would say tenure is slowly
inching less, like instead of a longer program, 3 years or 4 year programs, we
tend to see programs of shorter nature at a global level.
Gaurav Rateria: Secondly, on the BFS, you did talk about some better trend in North America
this quarter. Is there any reason to believe that the projects that you have
embarked upon would not continue in the near term? I'm just trying to
understand that from a visibility perspective, at least some of these projects
should continue if they are longer tenured, right? So, then from a visibility point
of view in the BFS vertical, there should be a decent visibility at least for the
near term?
K Krithivasan: As we told you before, Gaurav, as we see today, we don't see a bad or an
increasing trend of project cancellation. But at the same time, we remain
careful that customers do pause these programs at a shorter notice. So, as I
see today, it is continuing the same pace as it was before.
Gaurav Rateria: Last question from me. The headcount, we have seen a positive addition after
last several quarters. So is this a reflection of that utilization has kind of peaked
out or reached an optimal level where we should be? Or is it also a reflection
that our order book is to be executed in the coming quarters and hence we will
be needing more heads on the roles? Thank you.
Milind Lakkad: I think our hiring, we should not look at it from a quarterly standpoint. We look
at it means our training hiring, we look at it from an annual standpoint. And that
is the annual thing, core part of our strategy and that is how we hire. And there
is no direct linkage to the demand because it is also, this will go through a
significant amount of talent development and training and eventually they get
deployed to the projects.
So yes, some of it can be the factor because we have utilized on the
investments we made last year and the year before that. And some of it is also
because of the fact that we want to plan for this year properly.
Gaurav Rateria: Thank you.
